# HEXRO
HEXRO is a small six-legged robot, suitable for the planting of fruit trees and various seed crops in uncultivated, unfriendly, and uneven terrains. The main idea is for the robot to have different types of seeds in its hollow legs, allowing simultaneous planting of six different crops. At the same time, for planting trees or shoots that require greater sowing depth, HEXRO is equipped with a planting system, consisting of auger for soil and a tree feeder mechanism.

Its control system is based on Raspberry Pi 3 and 16-channel, 12-bit PWM Extender, based on the PCA9685 integrated circuit. The communication between HEXRO and the operator (the robots operator) is done via Wi-Fi. An universal Windows platform application has been developed to manage HEXRO.
